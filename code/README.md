## Code Files

Here are the code files of my implementation of thetwo main reference papers of this project. There is an [additional code file](./additional_scripts) implementing the paper on [_Encrypted model predictive control design for security to cyberattacks_](papers/Encrypted model predictive control design for security.pdf) in R, which was not used for generating the results included in the report, but is included in this repository as a learning.
